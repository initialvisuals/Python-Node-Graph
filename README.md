# Python-Node-Graph
A node editor for python programming

python main.py to run

Not COMPLETE YET, still need to work on editing and passing variables between node types and functionality for GPT based node, flow direction, output preview, other basic stuff. OOPS If you found this I guess hey this is just a riff. Can be used to build mesh network architecture with a little love and care. I've done it before! This example can be stripped to create a node based system that can handle distance between nodes(useful for simulating signal strength through walls and over distance) self healing connections where the nodes can disconnect and reconnect when certain principles are met etc. Unique IDs are working as well as connection counts, actual integer and string values are not filtered in nodes and there are bugs in the code base. Learning asset.
