# Python-Node-Graph
A node editor for python programming

python main.py to run

Not COMPLETE YET, still need to work on editing and passing variables between node types and functionality for GPT based node, flow direction, output preview, other basic stuff. OOPS If you found this I guess hey this is just a riff.
